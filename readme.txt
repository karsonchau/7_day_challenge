This is my seven challenge for Spoonity. I created a single view application using AngularJS 1.4.5.
For my API, I have used Zomato. My application will search twenty restaurants in a given city by a user.
The are three states to my application. The first is the search page for users to enter the city they would like
to search. The second page displays the list of cities that match the search from the user. If there are no
cities, "___ not found will be displayed". The third page will display the restaurants that the user has selected.
